# Scrum  Guide
A guide to all things scrum and agile based on my experience and training. This is practical setps and not B.S

## Scrum Team Size
5-7, including Dev, Doc, UX and QA. If there are more then break the team up per feature.

## PO Duties
- Serve as PO for at the most one product. May serve as consultant to other POs
- Keep the backlog groomed at all times with 2 sprints worth of stuff for Scrum team to do. 
- Actively engage with the team to setup grooming sessions when bucket is low.
- Consult any and all to make stories viable if not enough information
- Grooming the back log daily for clarifying requirements
- Proactively tell Scrum Master to setup grooming sessions here details are needed.

## Scrum Master Duties
- Ask what are the impedements and why are they impedements. One mans's impedement is another man's "really?". So make folks communicate
- Make the Scrum meetings schedules known in advance.
- Keep track of who is out of office and days off. It affects Velocity if not accounted for and team realize they have signed up for more work
- Raise technical issues with other team leads proactively. Impedements take top priority.
- Maintain a nice dashboard of the main metrics with trends of the metrics.
- Be an a-hole for Daily scrum. Its not a status meeting but communication.
- Pester team to mark their stories done if they are indeed done.
- Pester the team member who always says impedements on similar issues.
- Pester the team to help each other.
- In Groomings, refrain from assignment questions.

## Metrics To Collect
- Sprint Health = Story points done / story points planned
- Velocity = Story points / Sprint
- Cycle time = days from start to end
- A line trend of the 3 above with respect to number of people available

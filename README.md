# Scrum  Playbook
A play by play guide to all things Scrum and agile based on my experience and training. This are practical steps based on first hand experience.

## Scrum Team Size
5-7, including Dev, Doc, UX and QA. If there are more then break the team up per feature.

## PO Duties
- Serve as PO for at the most one product. May serve as consultant to other POs
- Keep the backlog groomed at all times with 2 sprints worth of stuff for Scrum team to do. 
- Actively engage with the team to setup grooming sessions when bucket is low.
- Consult any and all to make stories viable if not enough information
- Grooming the back log daily for clarifying requirements
- Proactively tell Scrum Master to setup grooming sessions here details are needed.

## Scrum Master Duties
- Ask what are the impedements and why are they impedements. One mans's impedement is another man's "really?". So make folks communicate
- Make the Scrum meetings schedules known in advance.
- Keep track of who is out of office and days off. It affects Velocity if not accounted for and team realize they have signed up for more work
- Raise technical issues with other team leads proactively. Impedements take top priority.
- Maintain a nice dashboard of the main metrics with trends of the metrics.
- Be an a-hole for Daily scrum. Its not a status meeting but communication.
- Pester team to mark their stories done if they are indeed done.
- Pester the team member who always says impedements on similar issues.
- Pester the team to help each other.
- In Groomings, refrain from assignment questions.
- During Sprint, change assignment based on whose court the ball is in.
- If Stories not complete, move them as is to next sprint and earn credit for them there. If you are working with average velocities anyway, this averages out and avoids the risk of overstating velocity.

## Metrics To Collect
- Sprint Health = Story points done / story points planned
- Velocity = Story points / Sprint
- Cycle time = days from start to end
- A line trend of the 3 above with respect to number of people available
